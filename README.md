- made my physical notes for every chapter but 16
- lost my notes for chapter 19 part 1, though those and the notes for part 2 were not the best regardless

just here for any a level student to stumble across

you don't actually need to go through any of the image files, just filter by type markdown (md) and you'll find all the relevant notes

i've added python implementations of the data structures and algorithms that you might want to memorise before the exam

i've also added a couple of solutions that i personally did for you to compare with yours or study from, in case you don't like the mark scheme's methods (they're very weird)

good luck guys :)
