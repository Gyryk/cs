- made my physical notes for every chapter but 16
- lost my notes for chapter 19 part 1, though those and the notes for part 2 were not the best regardless

just here for any a level student to stumble across

you don't actually need to go through any of the image files, just filter by type markdown (md) and you'll find all the relevant notes
